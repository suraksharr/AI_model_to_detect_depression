This AI model is used for the early detection of depression in people by just using their voice samples. Our model uses the features extracted from the voice samples and by some machine learning techniques, it 
could detect depression with very good accuracy. A real-world dataset has been used in this model to check the accuracy of the model. This model can be very useful in healthcare as it gives a clear-cut prediction on 
early diagnosis of depression. It is costefficient, minimal time consumption, and accurate hence providing great support to thehealthcare industry. It not only identifies depression but encourages people by
providing them insights into their mental well-being so that they can take proactive steps towards better mental health. This model is meant to be a little contribution and to raise self-awareness about mental
wellness among individuals.
